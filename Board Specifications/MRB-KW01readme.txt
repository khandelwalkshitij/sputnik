EXPLANATION OF MRB-KW01 DESIGN FILES

Board part numbers for the MRB-KW01 follow the convention MRB-KW01-XXYY where XX is the operating 
frequency and YY is the reference oscillator frequency.   The MKW01 development boards are all based on 
the same PCB design.  The different board part numbers designs differ only in the BOM.  

PCB design files included in this download are for the MRB-KW01-9032, the 900 MHz design for North 
America and EMEA.  The Design folder contains Allegro deign files and the Gerber fold contains gerber files 
for PCB fabrication.  The BOM folder contains the BOM for the currently available board part numbers.

The Development Hardware Reference Manual describing the design is in the PDF folder along with PDFs of 
the board layers, the schematic and the fab drawing.
