	\item[Customer requirements] \hfill \\ \\
		The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) needs a device that can be used for command, control, communications between a \textbf{CubeSat} and a \textbf{ground station}.
		A \textbf{CubeSat} is a miniature satellite that can be used for scientific research in space. It has a volume of one liter (10cm cube), and has a mass of no more than 1.33kg.
		A \textbf{ground station} is a radio station located on earth that is designed for communication with spacecraft.
		Development of such a device is not trivial as it will need to eventually be "space ready" and will require multiple phases of development. \hfill \\ \\
		The first phase of development will involve finding and de-risking a microcontroller that is capable of handling command, control, and communications.
		Therefore, the device will be a communications module "breakout board" that will allow easy access to the features of the microcontroller like UART, I2C, SPI, GPIO, ADCs/DACs, etc. Access to these features will rely on miscellaneous connectors such as .1 inch pin headers, USB, 6-pin JTAG, etc. Furthermore, as a project that is sponsored by PSAS it should adhere to their open source standards, while obeying governmental regulations.
